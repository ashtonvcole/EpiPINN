Experiments
- Forward
	- Replicate (noisy?) synthetic data
	- Two-stage training??
		- IC and data loss
		- Add in physics loss with fixed SEIRD parameters alpha, beta, gamma, mu, sigma
- Inverse
	- Find SEIRD parameters for (noisy?) synthetic data
	- Two-stage training??
		- IC and data loss
		- Add in physics loss with variable SEIRD parameters alpha, beta, gamma, mu, sigma
		
Notes for report
- Softmax accounts for conservation of people (mass?)
- Regularization is accounted for in the adams optimizer
