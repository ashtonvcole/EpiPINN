	abstract = {The explosive growth of civil applications of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) calls for control algorithms that enable safe and trustworthy operations, especially in complex environments to facilitate real-world deployment. Although Model-Based Control (MBC) has found great applicability in the last decades, it relies heavily on the accuracy of the underlying mathematical models. Thanks to their powerful approximation capability, datadriven approaches such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have raised a great interest in UAV dynamical modeling in recent years. Despite the promising results achieved in learning either full or partial dynamics such as aerodynamic effects, prior studies merely pay little to no attention to the black-box nature of ANNs, yielding poorly interpretable learning processes and implying a lack of generalization capability due to undesirably learned spurious relationships among features and labels. While nowadays practitioners and society are far from being concerned just with performance, such risk evidently reduces the overall trustworthiness of the control system with ANNs as control-oriented models. With the goal of both accurate and interpretable neural modeling of nonlinear dynamics, we propose a novel modeling approach that utilizes Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), designed to seamlessly embed physical laws into Deep Neural Networks (DNN). To further enhance model interpretability, we adopt the Covariance Confidence Ellipse (CCE) as post-hoc visualization to help understand the model behavior. We also set up a visual and physical simulator based on AirSim with custom implementation on quadrotor ground effect, which is made publicly available to facilitate further experiments for the community. An extensive simulation campaign validates our approach on data sets including aerodynamics and periodic wind, highlighting advantages regarding the accuracy and physical consistency, pointing to further insight on the development of learning-based control-oriented models for quadrotors, and facilitating flight controller design with performance guarantees.},

	abstract = {This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for SIR models with control. We then propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs (MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods under different settings.},

	abstract = {A method, advanced as the fractional Euler finite difference method (FEFDM), a general method for the finite difference discretization of fractional initial value problems (IVPs) for 0{\textless}α≤1 for the Caputo derivative, is shown to be valid only for α=1. This is accomplished by establishing, through a recently proposed generalized difference quotient representation of the fractional derivative, that the FEFDM is valid only if a property of the Mittag-Leffler function holds that has only been shown to be valid only for α=1. It is also shown that the FEFDM is inconsistent with the exact discretization of the IVP for the Caputo fractional relaxation equation. The generalized derivative representation is also used to derive a modified generalized Euler’s method, its nonstandard finite difference alternative, their improved Euler versions, and to recover a recent result by Mainardi relating the Caputo and conformable derivatives.},

	abstract = {The Caputo fractional-order differential operator is used in epidemiological models, but its accuracy benefits are typically ignored. We validated the suggested fractional epidemiological seasonal influenza model of the SVEIHR type to demonstrate the Caputo operator’s relevance. We analysed the model using fractional calculus, revealing its basic properties and enhancing our understanding of disease progression. Furthermore, the positivity, bounds, and symmetry of the numerical scheme were examined. Adjusting the Caputo fractional-order parameter α = 0.99 provided the best fit for epidemiological data on infection rates. We compared the suggested model with the Caputo fractional-order system and the integer-order equivalent model. The fractional-order model had lower absolute mean errors, suggesting that it could better represent sickness transmission and development. The results underline the relevance of using the Caputo fractional-order operator to improve epidemiological models’ precision and forecasting. Integrating fractional calculus within the framework of symmetry helps us build more reliable models that improve public health interventions and policies.},
